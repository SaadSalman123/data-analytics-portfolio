This section contains end-to-end analytics projects completed as part of my
MSc in Business Analytics. These projects demonstrate my ability to apply
data analytics, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling to real-world
business problems.

Each project includes:
- A clearly defined business problem
- Analytical methodology
- Key insights and outcomes
- Supporting code extracted from academic appendices where applicable
