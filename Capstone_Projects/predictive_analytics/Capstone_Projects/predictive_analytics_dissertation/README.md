# Predictive Analytics Dissertation – Python

## Overview
This project is focused on applying predictive analytics
and machine learning techniques to solve a real-world business problem.
The project follows an end-to-end analytics workflow from data preparation
to model evaluation and insight generation.

## Business Problem
Organisations need to anticipate future outcomes accurately in order to
improve decision-making, optimise resources, and reduce risk. This project
explores how predictive models can be used to forecast outcomes and support
data-driven business strategies.

## Dataset
The project uses structured datasets suitable for supervised learning,
containing multiple explanatory variables and a defined target variable.
Detailed dataset descriptions are provided in the full report.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Supervised Machine Learning models

## Methodology
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis
- Feature selection and engineering
- Model development (e.g. regression and tree-based models)
- Model evaluation and comparison

## Key Outcomes
- Predictive models were successfully built and evaluated
- Feature importance analysis identified key drivers of outcomes
- Model performance metrics were used to compare and select models

## Business Implications
- Enables proactive decision-making rather than reactive analysis
- Supports forecasting and risk reduction
- Demonstrates how predictive analytics can create measurable business value

## Code
The Python code used in this project is extracted from the appendix section
of the MSc dissertation and supports the data preprocessing, modelling,
and evaluation stages described in the report.
